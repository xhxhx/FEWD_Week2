  <h1>Nested Selectors in CSS</h1>

	<p>Often, we may find ourselves wanting to style things <em>differently</em> depending on their <em>context</em>.</p>

	<p>Take emphasis as an example. In typical copy, presented in a roman (non-italic) type, we may wish to add <em>emphasis</em> to a word or phrase by using <em>italics</em>.</p>

	<p>But what if we want to quote a <span class="famous">block of text</span> which also emphasizes something?</p>

	<blockquote>
  		<p>This is a quote from <span class="famous">some famous person</span> who undoubtedly has something <em>very important</em> to say.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>If we want our block quote to be set in italics by default, then the visual style for emphasis needs to be different, <em>but only when inside a blockquote</em>.</p>

	<p>This is where <em>nested selectors</em> come in handy.</p>
